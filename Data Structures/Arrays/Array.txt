Array is an non primitive data type which is used to store multiple values of similar data type.

int[] array;  Here arr is declared having named arr , it is getting declared in stack.(Declaration). Declaration happens at compile time.

arr = new int[5]; here object is being created in the heap memory.(Initialisation). Memory allocation happens at run time which is also known as dynamic memory allocation.

In java there may not be continuous memory allocation of array members / Heap objects are not continuous sometimes they can be and sometimes they may not be.  It depends on JVM.

Arrays are heap objects in java. 

In Java, null represents the absence of any value or the lack of an object reference.

By default any reference variable has null type.

Heap is a runtime memory area used by a program to allocate memory for its data dynamically

2D Arrays can be defined as array of arrays 

Java also supports jagged arrays, which are arrays where each row can have a different number of elements

Example of jagged array 
int[][] array = {
  {1, 2, 3},  // 1st row: 3 elements
  {4, 5},      // 2nd row: 2 elements
  {6, 7, 8, 9} // 3rd row: 4 elements
};

A jagged array is an array of references to arrays. Each row is a separate array object, and the length of each row can vary. Here's how the memory for your array might be structured:

The main array array holds references to three different arrays (the rows).
Each of those sub-arrays can have different lengths.
